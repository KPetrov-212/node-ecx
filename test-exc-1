Test the endpoints using your browser or a tool like Postman:

- **GET all items**: `http://localhost:3000/api/cars`
- **GET one item**: `http://localhost:3000/api/cars/1`
- **POST new item**: `http://localhost:3000/api/cars` (with JSON body)
- **DELETE item**: `http://localhost:3000/api/cars/1`

### Testing with curl (in terminal):

```bash
# Get all cars
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cars

# Get car by ID
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cars/1

# Add new car
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cars \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":4,"brand":"BMW","model":"M3","year":2023,"color":"Black"}'

# Delete a car
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/cars/2
```
